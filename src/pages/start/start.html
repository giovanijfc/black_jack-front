  <h3 class="t_Start">How it works?</h3>
  <p class="p_Start">The dealer gives two starting cards. At this point the player can choose to be alone with these two cards.</p>
  <p class="p_Start">At any time he can choose hit (pick up one more card) or stand (stop).</p>
  <p class="p_Start">If the player has cards with an added value greater than 21, he automatically loses.</p>
  <p class="p_Start">If the cards are 21, he wins automatically.</p>
  <p class="p_Start">If they add up to less than 21, the dealer picks up cards until he gets at least sum 17;
     the player wins if his hand adds more than the dealer's or if the dealer's hand exceeds 21 points. AZ is worth 11 only 11!
